                                 Level I Market Data:                
=============================================================================================================================================================

    Level 1 market data provides basic information on the current price of a security, the bid and ask prices, and the most recent trade. 
    This level of market data is typically available to the general public and is used by retail investors.

    Level 1 market data is one of the primary sources of financial market information. 
    It is the most basic level of market data, providing traders and investors with real-time stock quotes, trade volume, bid and ask prices, and other basic information.
    Level 1 data is essential for making informed trading decisions and monitoring market conditions.

    Level 1 market data provides real-time quotes and trade data for a particular stock or security. This includes:

    • Current market price:

        The current market price is the most recent price at which a stock was traded. 
        This price is constantly changing as trades occur.

    • Bid and ask prices: 
    
        The bid price is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a stock, while the ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept.
        The difference between the bid and ask prices is known as the spread.

    • Trade volume: [Bid size, Ask size]

        Trade volume is the number of shares that have been traded in a particular stock over a given period of time. 
        This information can provide insight into the level of market activity for a particular stock.

    • Ticker symbol: 

        The ticker symbol is a unique identifier for a particular stock.
        It is used to track the stock’s price and trading activity.

    • Time and sales data: 

        Time and sales data provides a detailed record of all trades that have occurred for a particular stock.
        This information can be used to analyze market behavior and identify trends.

    • Last price: The price at which the most recent trade was completed

    • Last size: The number of shares, lots, or contracts traded in the most recent trade

                                 Level II Market Data:                
=============================================================================================================================================================

    Level 2 market data provides more detailed information than Level 1 market data, including the best bids and offers for a particular security. 
    This level of market data is typically used by active traders who need more information than what is available in Level 1 data.
    This data is typically only available to professional traders and is usually provided by specialized financial data vendors.


    The key feature of Level 2 data is that it shows the actual prices and quantities of buy and sell orders for a particular security.
    This is in contrast to Level 1 market data, which only shows the best bid and ask prices. For example, if a stock is currently trading at $50 per share, 
    Level 1 data might show that the best bid price is $49.95 and the best ask price is $50.05. 
    Level 2 data, on the other hand, would show all the buy and sell orders for that stock at various price levels, such as $49.95, $50.00, and $50.05.

    Ключевой особенностью данных 'Level 2' является то, что они показывают фактические цены и количество заявок на покупку и продажу конкретной ценной бумаги.
    Это отличается от рыночных данных уровня 1, которые показывают только лучшие цены предложения и продажи. Например, если акция в настоящее время торгуется по цене 50 долларов за штуку, 
    Данные уровня 1 могут показать, что наилучшая цена предложения составляет 49,95 долларов, а наилучшая цена предложения - 50,05 долларов. 
    С другой стороны, данные уровня 2 будут показывать все заказы на покупку и продажу этих акций на различных ценовых уровнях, таких как $49,95, $50,00 и $50,05.


    • Highest bid prices:

        The highest bid prices are the prices (usually at least several prices are shown) where traders have placed orders to buy.
        This means you see the current bid and the bids currently below it.
        Actively traded stocks typically have bids every $0.01 below the current bid, and in actively traded futures, there is typically a bid for each tick below the current bid.
        Gaps between the current bid and the next bid typically mean the stock or contract has a larger bid/ask spread and less volume.

    • Lowest ask prices

        The lowest prices (usually at least several prices are shown) where traders have placed orders to sell.
        This means you see the current ask and the asks currently above it.
        Actively traded stocks typically have asks (offers) every $0.01 above the current offer, and in actively traded futures, there is typically an offer for each tick above the current offer.
        Gaps between the current ask and the next ask typically mean the stock or contract has a larger bid/ask spread and less volume.

    • Bid sizes

        The number of shares, lots, or futures contracts available at each of the bid prices.

    • Ask sizes

        The number of shares, lots, or futures contracts available at each of the ask prices
